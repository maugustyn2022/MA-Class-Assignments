* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
tZero grew out of Medici Ventures and it's parent company Overstock.com. Overstock has sponsored numerous projects and subsidiaries invovled with blockchain technologies. The business rationale was to create an alternative medium for companies to acquire funding outside of traditional public markets.    

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Funded by overstock.com, and by the specific token float for Tzero performed on their distributed ledger. Total funding amount per crunchbase is $472 million. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
tZero's core value proposition is similar to that of security tokens in general, it's platform lowers the barrier for assets to be securitized and publicly traded. Per research performed online a general list of benefits includes: 1. lower fees 2. faster deal execution 3. free market exposure 4. larger investor base (glabal markets)  5. Automated service function (less legal, transaction advisors, etc.) 6. Lack of financial institution manipulation

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The company caters to two primary customers. 1. Owners of illiquid assets interested in issuing token securities 2. Investors who want exposure to the assets being securitized.

Owners of illiquid assets can be individuals, institutions, or even governments. tZero for example facilitated the issuance of tokens that entitle holders to an equity stake in the St. Regis Aspen Resort, under the title of "ASPEN". The ultimate majority owner of the asset is "Elevated Returns", which appears to be a small team of former investment bankers and consultants that have ambitions to tokenize a large portfolio of real estate assets in the coming years. 

Investors for the first several year's of tZero's existence were required to be accredited investors, since 2019 non-accredited investors have also been permitted to transact on the platform. tZero's leadership has indicated in an interview on "Real Vision", a financial news source that building trust with regulators has been challenging, but a process they are making progress on. This will be key moving forward, as demonstrating to regulators that their platform is safe for retail investors will greatly impact how many active users the company can attract to its token offerings due to their being far more non accredited than accredited investors in the United States.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The main advantage they have realized is that they are approved and regulated by the SEC as an alternative trading service. This has taken years to achieve, and is likely to remain a substantial "moat" around the firm's business. However, increased scrutiny surrounding consumer financial protection from the incoming Biden administration could substantially change the regulatory paradigm tZero is currently well positioned within.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
tZero makes use of proprietary technology that allows the digitization of illiquid assets. All buyers and sellers on tZero's alternative trading system trade through a "dark pool" , with tZero operating as the matchmaker. 

The various technologies are implemented using the below eco-system:

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Alternative trading systems, as defined by the SEC. They provide a blockchain ecosystem and secondary market, with an emphasis on illiquid assets.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
The industry is extremely new, with tZero as the market leader only having listed three novel securities (it also runs an application where inividuals can trade popular crypto currencies). 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Tokensoft and openfinance are both firms active in the digitization of alternative assets and the operation of a secondary market for said assets

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
This company has executed successful token security floats for itself, a real estate asset, and it's ultimate parent company on its platform. More broadly, it is viewed as a market leader and developed credibility with regulators and traditional secondary market providers.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
Trade volume seems to be the primary point of comparison, as a high level of liquidity is a core characteristic of any successful exchange. Which market providers attract the most interesting assets and companies seeking to digitize their equity will also be a key point of differentiation.   

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Being regulated is a major advantage and it has proven its ability to execute. Based on publicly information it is likely not profitable, but being backstopped by a major ecommerce company will likely afford it a substantially longer runway than its peers.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) / Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I would continue to capitalize on the global real estate market. Real estate is the largest single asset class globally, with over $200 Trillion dollars in estimated value. Real estate also has huge intermediation costs relative to other markets, with lawyers and brokers collecting premium levels of compensation due to the historical opacity and localized nature of the industry.  

Beyond real estate, another natural extension of the platform would be to infrastructure assets. Infrastructure assets are highly illiquid, involve immense transaction costs, and currently only accesible to highly specialized institutional investors.

Lastly, I would advise them to continue efforts to expand the platform outside of the United States through the listing of mature, professionally run emerging market businesses. Companies with this profile have exceptional return potential, particularly from a value perspective given the asset inflation that has occurred in most major public markets in the wake of the financial crisis. However, realizing this final goal is likely long term given the regulatory challenges that would likely be encountered.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? / Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These additional products would require minimal new technology. However, I would consider providing an enterprise resource planning system to prospective capital raising entities to provide ongoing reporting and operational management, as this could make it simple for reporting to be more robust and standardized across all companies and assets digitized by tZero. One component of this would be to provide an exchange compliant real estate asset accounting application to a company seeking to digitize a real estate asset. Real estate asset reporting is highly non-uniform, and enforcing standardization through a helpful tool would benefit all members of the exchange ecosystem.
